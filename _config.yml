# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.

# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  We're looking for administrators, developers, and engineers that are interested
  in systems automation with tools in the Puppet ecosystem as well as tools that can be used in conjunction with Puppet.

  The only prerequisite is that you have an open mind and the willingness to both learn and share!

  Note: This is not a group related to traditional puppetry or live-show entertainment.
